# üêä Blog Aggregator

**Blog Aggregator** is a microservice CLI RSS feed aggregator written in Go! We'll call the CLI tool `gator` because it is an aggreGATOR üêä. This app allows you to:

* Add RSS feeds from across the internet.
* Store collected posts in a PostgreSQL database.
* Follow and unfollow RSS feeds from other users.
* View summaries of aggregated posts in the terminal, with links to full posts.

RSS feeds are a convenient way to keep up with blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more.

## Installing the CLI

You can install the CLI using:

```

This will install a `blog-aggregator` executable you can use in your terminal.

## Configuration

`gator` uses a JSON config file located at `~/.gatorconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "db_url": "postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/blog_aggregator",
  "current_user_name": "your_username"
}
```

* `db_url`: Connection string to your PostgreSQL database.
* `current_user_name`: Automatically set by the application after using the register.
